Hello everyone, this is your first project.

Task 1 :
You are to create a simple webpage displaying your personal details :

Your course (frontend or backend engineering)

POINTERS :

HTML Structure:
Start with the basic HTML structure: <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, and <body>.

Personal Details Section:
Inside the <body>, create a section for personal details.
Include your name, sex, and preferred stack using appropriate HTML tags (e.g., <h1>, <p>).

Image:
Add an image of yourself using the <img> tag. Make sure the image is stored in the same folder as your HTML file.

CSS Styling :
Apply basic styling using CSS to enhance the visual appeal. Experiment with font styles, colors, and padding.

Responsive Design (Optional):
If you're up for it, make your webpage responsive by using simple media queries to adapt the layout for different screen sizes.

Save and Preview:
Save your HTML file and open it in a web browser to see how it looks. Make adjustments as needed.

Reflective Documentation:
Write a short reflection on what you learned while creating the webpage, any challenges faced, and improvements you'd like to make.
Remember, the key is to keep it simple and focus on the fundamentals. Enjoy the process of creating your first webpage!

Submissions will be on the first physical class we'll have.
Good luck.
